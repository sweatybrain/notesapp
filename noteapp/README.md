hey this is a notes app built on to run on the browser with react, it is simple and actually very little 
was implemented by hand since a lot we've just taken from already existing libraries. this was a scrimba
exercise to practice the basics of react.

Quick start:

```
$ yarn # npm install
$ yarn build # npm run build
````

## Development

Run Webpack in watch-mode to continually compile the JavaScript as you work:

```
$ yarn watch # npm run watch
